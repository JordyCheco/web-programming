My name is Jordy Checo and I've attended Suny New Paltz for four years so far this semester is the first semester of my Senior Year. A couple of intrestings about me is that I work on campus as a Student Ambassador which means I give tours around campus to students and families interested in coming to New Paltz. I genuinely do like my job as I meet so many interesting people as have had conversations with people who've been working in the Computer science field getting insight into what the Job  Market is like. When thinking about my computer experience so far it has mostly stuck to school projects and the courses I've taken. I'm genuinely excited about some of the projects I'm taking on this semester. For example, for Software Engineering I and my group decided to create a video game using Unreal Engine 4. This is genuinely exciting to me as I love video games and the work that goes into so to finally dip my toes into the world of game development is an exciting challenge that I'm excited to face.

When it comes to this Web Programing course what I want is to have a solid understanding of how web programming works. Web development is a career path I can seriously see myself doing so it's something I want to learn how to do. I've learned how to program with HTML and CSS I do truly enjoy working with them because they're relatively easy to pick up and get a good understanding of. My main goal this semester is to make something I'm proud of so I'm able to show companies what I'm capable of and also be able to build off what I learn through this course and create a possible career out of it. I know this course is going to push me as I’ll be learning a whole new field of programming that I’ve never tackled before but I know I’m more than capable to handle it.
